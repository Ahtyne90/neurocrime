  <!-- Section 1: Problem -->
  <section class="problem">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> What is the problem?</h2>
    <p>
      Some technologies allow <strong>secret manipulation of memories and emotions</strong> through microimplants in the brain.
      These systems operate in a <strong>closed-loop mode</strong> – implants send data to the cloud, where
      <strong>predictive algorithms</strong> (LSTM, RNN, CNN, and others) decode hippocampal activity and can deliver stimulation on demand,
      influencing memory and emotional responses.
    </p>
    <p>
      This technology, in scientific literature, is known as <strong>Ca²⁺ imaging</strong>, enabled by modern methods such as:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>NIRS (Near-Infrared Spectroscopy)</strong> – measures neuron activity via light signal changes</li>
        <li><strong>Doppler Focused Ultrasound</strong> – precise stimulation and readout of signals in specific brain regions</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The implant is a microscopic chip that transmits data to the cloud, allowing remote control in a feedback loop.
      <strong>From a technological standpoint, it is potentially possible to build such systems</strong> using current or near-future
      methods of neural recording and stimulation. This does not mean that any specific implementation has been independently verified,
      but the principles are within the realm of modern neuroscience and engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Unfortunately, many of these experiments are conducted illegally</strong> – in some psychiatric clinics and medical
      university settings worldwide, often without full patient consent. Victims often do not know how to seek help and are treated
      as mentally ill.

    <h2><i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i> Why We Need Your Help</h2>
    <p>
      To gather <strong>evidence for local prosecutors and human rights organizations</strong>, measurements and observations are essential:
      <ul>
        <li>Electromagnetic and NIR/ultrasound studies</li>
        <li>Monitoring brain activity in controlled environments (e.g., Faraday cages or shielded safe zones)</li>
      </ul>
      Without these data, victims remain defenseless, and the practice is international and difficult to prove.

    			<p><strong>Contact:</strong> karolinariddle2@gmail.com</p>
    		<p><a href="https://www.worldbrainmapping.org/" target="_blank">World Brain Mapping Organization</a></p>

    		<h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> The Issue</h2>
    		<p>
      The problem involves <strong>illicit experimentation in psychiatric clinics at medical universities worldwide</strong>. 
      These experiments are often disguised as "neurofeedback training" but rely on nanotechnology to manipulate human behavior.
      Evidence suggests that the <strong>World Brain Mapping Organization (WBMO)</strong> is connected to these projects.
    		</p>
    		<p>
      Tiny neuro-engineering nanobots and microchips can be implanted without surgery, sometimes using only skin sensors. These devices
      can potentially control brain activity and emotional responses, targeting areas like the hippocampus.
    		</p>

    		<h2><i class="fas fa-user-secret"></i> My Experience</h2>
    		<p>
      I have personally been a victim of this illegal experimentation, and I know that many others are suffering silently. The individuals
      behind these experiments are confident they can evade detection, making it crucial to gather evidence.
    		</p>

    		<h2><i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i> Why Help is Needed</h2>
    		<p>
      Gathering evidence is critical to exposing these practices and holding perpetrators accountable. Victims are threatened with psychological
      torture and brain manipulation. By collecting data, we can support victims and inform authorities.
    		</p>

    		<h2><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> How Technology is Used</h2>
    		<p>
      The experiments rely on advanced technologies like <strong>Ca²⁺ imaging, NIRS, and Doppler Focused Ultrasound</strong>. Implants transmit
      data to the cloud, where predictive algorithms (LSTM, RNN, CNN) decode neural activity and deliver closed-loop stimulation.

                <p>"<strong>As global conflicts assume increasingly asymmetric and “gray zone” forms, the ability to employ
                    current and newly developing techniques and tools of neurocognitive science to manipulate human thought and behavior must be viewed
                    as a present and increasing challenge.</strong>[1] Ongoing developments in neuroscience and technology (neuroS/T), which trend 
                    toward 5- to 10-year trajectories of progression, make the brain sciences valid, viable"</p>

                <p>"In the former sense, neuroS/T research and development can be utilized to exercise socio-economic power in global markets,
                    while in the latter sense, neuroS/T can be employed to augment friendly forces’ capabilities or to denigrate the cognitive,
                    emotive, and/or behavioral abilities of hostiles"</p>
                <p>"While many types of weaponizable neuroS/T (for example, chemicals, biological agents, and toxins) have been addressed
                    in and by extant forums, treaties, conventions, and laws, other newer techniques and technologies have not.[4 ]
                    Thus, particular advances in neuroS/T have an increased potential for dual use"</p>
                <p>The U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information website was created in 1998, and it remains one of the largest resources
                   for biological information, being continuously updated by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (..)”</p>

                <p>"As digitization and automation become more available, continue to advance, and are further integrated into various laboratories
                    and medical centers, the procurement of and access to biodata will greatly simplify several dimensions and domains of biomedical research.
                    Many countries have overtly—or more surreptitiously—begun to collect and utilize data to foster biotechnological innovation"</p>

                <p>"The concurrent collection of genetic and environmental/behavioral data can be essential to acquiring considerable knowledge about
                    diverse aspects of human terrain.[38] "</p>

                <p>"[2 ]Previously we have analyzed the unique risks associated with biodata along a continuum of harms from individual privacy,
                    to physical harm to individuals and groups—and we have highlighted the cyberbiosecurity risks specific to these domains.[43]
                    Here, we direct a similar examination by identifying the subset of biodata obtained from and operationalized within neuroS/T.
                    We believe this subset represents a specialized landscape of vulnerabilities unlike any other in the cyberbiosecurity arena,
                    as it could impact human mental health, cognitive states, emotional states, decisionmaking, and behavior. Such ability to
                    coerce or otherwise control human beings via access to neurobiological manipulation is profound in both WINS and sociopolitical
                    contexts. We envision two possible vectors of threat/ harm: (1) the manipulation of neurodata in order to incur a direct/indirect
                    effect on the way an individual or group is regarded and/or treated; and (2) the access and use of neurodata to design a precision
                    effect on an individual or a group (see Figure 1). "</p>

                <p>"We consider these potential dual uses of neurodata to be a first but significant step in a pathway intended to produce neuropsychiatric
                    threat and harm."</p>
                <p>"Without proper surveillance and international cooperation, there is opportunity to bypass the BTWC, CWC, and other international
                    regulations through (1) various types of commercial veiling strategies; (2)<strong>venture capitalist financing of “do-it-yourself”/biohacker
                    scientists to conduct neuroS/T research for malevolent purposes</strong>" </p>

                <p></p>
                
                <p>Recent researches reveal evidences that the technological transnational companies,
                   in illicit association with USA, European Community and China governments and the corrupt 
                 Latin American governments, have created an organization that is developing mainly in Latin America a secret, 
                 <strong>forced and illicit neuroscientific human experimentation with invasive neurotechnology, brain nanobots,
                 microchips and implants to execute neuroscientific projects,2–5 </strong> which can have even led scientists to win 
                     Medicine Nobel Prizes6 based on this illicit human experimentation at the expense of Latin Americans' health.

                 The main potential harmful effects caused by this illicit human experimentation with nanobots in society include:

                 Mind control,7,8 memory deletion, torture, permanent espionage, theft of private information, extortion, sterilization, 
                 psychiatric disorders, suicide, and digital slavery.6</p>
                <p>The actions of this nanotechnology mafia are facilitated because nanobots can be administered in foods and drinks, 
                  being one of the main ones the alcohol drinks like beer since it depresses the individual's central nervous system 
                  and he loses his self-control and therefore, it facilitates mind control by others via brain nanobots; 
                  for this reason, the beer is ideal to administer brain nanobots.</p>
                <p>The illicit nanotechnology has also allowed appearing a new kind of criminals, operators that could be called “nano-hired killers"
                   or “nano-torturers”, those responsible for the "dirty work" of nanomafia, group mainly conformed by journalists, university students
                <p>who would be responsible for performing several works including: selection of the victim, to choose “the person of interest”, 
                   person who can contribute with some benefit to the nanomafia; intoxication of the victim with nanobots through food, drinks or pills
                   or his/her kidnapping to install them brain implants; editing, selection and commercialization of mind videos obtained with
                   the daily espionage using the Brain net, mind torture, victim torture disclosing his/her privacy information and espionage of dreams;
                   obtaining information from the dreams with the Brain net for extortion; creation of pseudo-diseases blocking the function of organs
                   by telemetry to then extort the victim with "the cure".</p>
                <p>It is necessary to emphasize that the criminal activity of this nanomafia, “the ghost mafia”, “the wifi mafia”, must be known
                   by the society in all areas because it can affect any society sector and for the power of its weapons like the Brain net. 
                   The magnitude of this mafia can only be compared to that of drug trafficking. There actually are many similarities between the drug
                   trafficking and this “nanotrafficking” organized by nanomafias, although the main crime element is different, in the former it is
                   the coca leaf and in the latter it is the brain nanobot, both can damage the mental health,</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>If the victim of tortures by wifi reports it, he/she can be unjustifiably considered as a person with psychiatric problems
                 or a slanderer, for that reason, the crime uses wifi as secret torture weapon</strong></p>

    <h2>Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)</h2>
    <p>
        A brain computer interface (BCI) basically translates the thoughts to the machine action (computer) 
        by decoding the brain activities. The signals generated by the nerves in the brain are acquired first 
        and then a number of steps are undergone to find out whether these signals form a pattern or not. 
        <strong>The main objective of any BCI system is to detect any such pattern from the neural activity 
        of a person's brain and then decode the actual intent of that person from it to drive or communicate 
        with machines. This system then converts the acquired signals into machine understandable signals.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The mapping of neural signals or imaging of activities taking place in different regions of the human brain 
        has been made possible by using different sensors which have the capability of detecting any physical change 
        in those regions. At the beginning, scientists thought that this system will be very helpful for reinstating 
        people with disabilities to their former state and improve the quality of life (Lebedev, M. A., 2006). 
        For that purpose, people are trained to manipulate their thought so as to control the external device.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apart from rehabilitation, brain computer interface (BCI) has found application in various other domains like 
        communication (Wolpaw, J. R. et al., 2002).
    </p>
    <p>
        In case of non-invasive BCIs, the signals are acquired superficially using a number of technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are mainly three types of BCI systems available, namely invasive, partially-invasive and non-invasive BCI 
        (Vourvopoulos, A. et al., 2012). In case of non-invasive BCIs, the signals are acquired superficially using 
        a number of technologies.

    <h1>Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) and Neural Interfaces</h1>

    <p>"A brain computer interface (BCI) basically translates thoughts into machine actions (computer)

        and then processed to detect patterns. The main objective of any BCI system is to detect such
        patterns from neural activity and decode the actual intent of a person to drive or communicate
        with machines."</p>

    <p>The mapping of neural signals or imaging activities in different brain regions is made possible
        by using various sensors capable of detecting physical changes. Initially, BCIs were developed
        to assist people with disabilities and improve quality of life (Lebedev, M. A., 2006).</p>

    <p>"Apart from rehabilitation, BCIs have applications in communication (Wolpaw, J. R. et al., 2002)
        and control of external devices."</p>

    <p><strong>The main goal of any BCI system is decoding neural patterns to interpret intentions
        and convert them into machine-understandable signals for controlling devices.</strong></p>

    <p>Non-invasive BCIs acquire signals superficially using EEG, fNIRS, or other neuroimaging technologies.
        There are three types of BCI systems: invasive, partially-invasive, and non-invasive
        (Vourvopoulos, A. et al., 2012).</p>

    <p>"Over the past decade, fNIs have evolved to incorporate diverse multidisciplinary approaches.
        Advanced fNIs explore neuromodulation and recording, partially inspired by optogenetics.
        Funding initiatives like BRAIN and SPARC in the USA promote neurotechnology development,
        with fNIs being a major focus."</p>

    <p><strong>Challenges addressed by nano fNIs:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Susceptibility of the abiotic-biotic interface to immune responses</li>
            <li>Communication inefficiency across the interface</li>
        </ul>
        Nano fNIs offer more effective solutions to these challenges, enhancing signal fidelity and
        biocompatibility.

    <p>"Affective BCIs (aBCIs) estimate human emotional states from brain signals, enabling adaptation
        of devices or environments to user affect. Studies show affective states are critical for
        decision-making, learning, and reasoning."</p>

    <p class="red_text">The ability to detect and manage affective states through BCIs has important
        implications for human-computer interaction and neuroadaptive technologies.</p>

    <p>EEG-based aBCIs provide non-invasive monitoring of neural correlates of emotion with high
        temporal resolution, allowing real-time estimation and response to user affect.</p>

    <p class="normal_text_header_2">Fabien Lotte, Laurent Bougrain, Maureen Clerc</p>
    <p>"BCIs can be active, reactive, or passive. Active BCIs rely on voluntary mental commands,
        reactive BCIs respond to external stimuli, and passive BCIs estimate mental states
        without voluntary input to adapt systems in real-time [15]."</p>

    <p><strong>Additional insights:</strong> Advanced BCIs can also enable neural feedback,
        cognitive augmentation, and assistive communication for paralyzed patients (Lebedev & Nicolelis,
        2017). Emerging research in hybrid BCIs combines EEG with fNIRS or EMG to improve
        signal reliability and versatility.</p>

  <h2>Guidelines for Victims: How to Find the Right Specialists</h2>
  <p>
    If you suspect the presence of unauthorized micro- or nanochips operating in the 
    <strong>1–5 GHz range</strong> on or inside your body, it is essential to seek 
    professional measurements and documentation.
  </p>
  <p> Remeber that behind it all is World Brain Mapping Organization and psychiatric clinics from medical universities</p>
  <p>
    The following types of specialists and laboratories are most relevant for detecting and analyzing 
    such signals:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Radio Engineering and Telecommunications Engineers</strong> – experts in measuring 
    radio, GSM, Wi-Fi, 5G, and radar signals using spectrum analyzers and antenna systems.</li>
    <li><strong>EMC/EMI Specialists (Electromagnetic Compatibility & Interference)</strong> – perform 
    tests in <strong>anechoic (non-reflective) chambers</strong> to analyze electromagnetic emissions 
    and susceptibility.</li>
    <li><strong>RF (Radio Frequency) Engineers</strong> – focus on frequencies from tens of kHz up to 
    hundreds of GHz, including RFID, satellite, and radar technologies.</li>
    <li><strong>Electromagnetics Physicists and Engineers</strong> – model and measure fields at micro- 
    and nano-scales.</li>
    <li><strong>Radiolocation and Radar Experts</strong> – specialize in emitting and detecting radio waves.</li>
    <li><strong>Biomedical Engineers (Neurotechnology, MedTech)</strong> – measure interactions between 
    electromagnetic waves and the human body, including EEG, MEG, and electromagnetic stimulation.</li>
    <li><strong>Electromagnetic Field Metrology Laboratories</strong> – state or private facilities 
    that certify and measure radiation of devices (SAR, EIRP).</li>
    <li><strong>Near-Infrared (NIR) & Optoelectronics Specialists</strong> – for cases where near-infrared 
    fluorescence or light-based control is suspected.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong style="font-weight:900; color:red;">
      Performing such measurements is absolutely necessary!
    </strong> Always request measurements in certified laboratories with 
    <strong>anechoic chambers</strong> whenever possible. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to anechoic chambers, measurements can also be conducted using:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Field measurements with spectrum analyzers and directional antennas.</li>
    <li>SAR (Specific Absorption Rate) analysis – often used for IoT devices and mobile phones.</li>
    <li>Interferometry and advanced electromagnetic field scanners.</li>
    <li>NIR/NIR-II fluorescence detection – if light-based or optical signaling is suspected.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Potential facilities include: <strong>telecommunication research institutes</strong>, 
    <strong>universities (electronics, telecommunication, mechatronics departments)</strong>, 
    <strong>state metrology institutes</strong>, and <strong>certification laboratories</strong> 
    (CE, FCC testing centers).

  <h2>Guidelines for Victims: How to Find the Right Specialists</h2>
  <p>
    If you suspect the presence of unauthorized <strong>micro- or nanochips operating in the 1–5 GHz range</strong> 
    implanted <strong>in or directly on your skin</strong>, it is crucial to act quickly. 
    Current neuroscience and neurotechnology confirm that <strong>direct, precise mind control cannot be performed remotely without a physical chip or similar implanted microdevice</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For such control, two components are generally necessary:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>A micro- or nanochip</strong> — a device that can receive, process, and transmit signals (most often in the GHz range).</li>
    <li><strong>Specific molecules or nanoparticles</strong> — introduced to the body, which can selectively bind to 
    subregions of the brain: the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the brainstem.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These brain regions play critical roles:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hippocampus</strong> – responsible for memory formation, spatial orientation, and learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Amygdala</strong> – processes fear, emotions, and emotional memory.</li>
    <li><strong>Brainstem</strong> – controls basic life functions (breathing, heart rate, consciousness).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong style="font-weight:900; color:red;">
      Mind control at a distance without a physical chip is not scientifically supported and is considered impossible with current technology.
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Detection methods:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Radio Engineering, RF, EMC/EMI specialists</strong> – for signal detection (1–5 GHz) using spectrum analyzers and anechoic chambers.</li>
    <li><strong>Ultrasound (USG)</strong> – chips larger than ~0.5 mm may sometimes be detected via soft-tissue ultrasound scans.</li>
    <li><strong>Electromagnetic field metrology labs</strong> – for radiation analysis and certification.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong style="font-weight:900; color:red;">
      Performing measurements is absolutely essential! 
    </strong> Always request <strong>anechoic chamber tests</strong> or certified laboratory analysis whenever possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you already performed such measurements, or if a chip was detected using any imaging method (including ultrasound), 
    <strong style="font-weight:900; color:red;">
      contact Martyna Ryba: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> or +48 575 062 128 immediately!
